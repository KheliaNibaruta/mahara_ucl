This SASS library does CSS magic to display vector-based graphics for icons. Note
that it also includes content in theme/raw/fonts/font-awesome.

Download the latest release, e.g. web version and locate the scss folder.
Extract webfonts into theme/raw/fonts/font-awesome.

To update the sass files part go to their git repo
and copy the contents of their /scss/ directory to our
htdocs/theme/raw/sass/lib/font-awesome/ directory.

Apply the .patches for customisations:
  htdocs/theme/raw/sass/lib/font-awesome/fa_customisations.patch

Manual customusations:
  Note: You will need to do at least the following
  - Edit htdocs/theme/raw/sass/lib/font-awesome/_variables.scss
    - set the $fa-font-path to be the path to our location of the fonts
    - Set the $fa-css-prefix  to be 'icon' (not 'fa')
  - Make sure htdocs/theme/raw/sass/lib/font-awesome/fontawesome.scss
  still has the lines:
  @import 'solid';
  @import 'brands';
  @import 'regular';
  - Make sure the htdocs/theme/raw/sass/lib/font-awesome/_mixins.scss
    and htdocs/theme/raw/sass/lib/font-awesome/_screen-reader.scss have
    the .sr-only to .visually-hidden changes

- If doing a major version upgrade you will also need to update
instances of font-family: 'Font Awesome x Free'  (where x is the
current major version)
